      |110 troops = 27.5 (28) per side = 14 per slice
      |drop points = 32 per side, 16 per slice
      |drops from 3-30 on each side (leaving room for fingers to make realistic)
      |adds 10 tiles from red line to drop at edge of diamond

      |Note2: This attack will only drop barbarians and archers (and selected heroes and castle).  
      |Other available troops will not be dropped, and will just reduce the amount of archers
      |and barbs that will be dropped in each attack.
