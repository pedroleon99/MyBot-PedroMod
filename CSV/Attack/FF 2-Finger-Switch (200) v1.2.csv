NOTE  |By rontimes
NOTE  |Version 1.2
NOTE  |Special thanks to @Rhinoceros for the inspiration and base code

      |100 troops = 25 per side = 13 per slice
      |drop points = 34 per side, 17 per slice
      |drops from 3-32 on each side (leaving room for fingers to make realistic)

      |Note2: This attack will only drop barbarians and archers (and selected heroes and castle).  
      |Other available troops will not be dropped, and will just reduce the amount of archers
      |and barbs that will be dropped in each attack.
